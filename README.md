# HTTP-FILTER
HTTP FILTER is a fast and efficient Bash tool that automates HTTP response code analysis for security researchers, penetration testers, and bug bounty hunters. It processes a list of URLs concurrently, categorizing them into separate files based on HTTP status codes (e.g., 200.txt, 404.txt, 500.txt).
